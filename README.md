# Bash Scripting

## Overview
This lab focused on developing a basic Bash script using the Linux terminal. The script demonstrates the use of functions, variable storage, system command integration, and user interaction. The project includes three core functions: displaying the current date/time, showing IP and port information, and encrypting/decrypting text using a Caesar cipher. It reinforces fundamental scripting logic and best practices in shell programming.

## Skills Practiced
- Creating and executing shell scripts with `chmod +x`
- Writing Bash functions with local variables and command output
- Using system tools like `hostname`, `curl`, and `nmap`
- Accepting and validating user input
- Implementing a Caesar cipher with loops and ASCII manipulation
- Structuring code with comments and logical flow

## Tools Used
- Bash shell (Linux terminal)
- Nano text editor
- `hostname -I` for private IP
- `curl ifconfig.me` for public IP
- `nmap scanme.nmap.org` for open ports
- Bash built-in commands (`echo`, `date`, `read`, loops, variables)

## Key Takeaways
- Script design is just as important as functionality—clear sections and comments improve readability and maintenance.
- Combining built-in Bash commands with external tools creates powerful, real-world automation scripts.
- Caesar cipher scripting required careful handling of character shifting and input validation.
- Frequent testing and debugging help isolate and fix issues early—copying small blocks at a time is better than pasting large, unverified sections of code.
